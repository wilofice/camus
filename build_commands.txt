  To build the Camus executable, you need to run these commands:

  First time setup:

  # Create build directory and configure CMake
  mkdir build
  cmake -B build

  Building the executable:

  # Build the project
  cmake --build build

  The executable location:

  The executable will be at: build/camus

  Clean rebuild (if needed):

  # Remove build directory and start fresh
  rm -rf build
  mkdir build
  cmake -B build
  cmake --build build

  Quick rebuild after code changes:

  # Just run the build command - CMake will detect changes
  cmake --build build

  That's it! The cmake --build build command is all you need to run each time you make changes to the source code.
