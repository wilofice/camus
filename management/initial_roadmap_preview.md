Of course, I would be glad to assist you in this exciting project. Here is a comprehensive initial overview of the plan to develop a local version of a CLAUDE CODE CLI using an open-source LLM.

## Project: Local-First, C++ Powered CLAUDE CODE CLI with `llama.cpp`

### 1. Phase 1: Study and Specification Definition

This initial phase is crucial for laying a solid foundation for the project. We will focus on understanding the landscape, defining clear goals, and outlining the technical requirements.

* **1.1. Market and Technology Analysis:**
    * **Open Source LLM Evaluation:** We will start by identifying and evaluating the most suitable open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation, with a particular focus on their proficiency in C++. Key candidates include models from the Code Llama and Mistral families. Our evaluation criteria will include performance, accuracy in code-related tasks, and compatibility with the `llama.cpp` framework.
    * **Competitive Analysis:** We will analyze existing code interaction CLIs to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and key features. This will help us to define our unique value proposition.

* **1.2. Specification Document:**
    * **Functional Specifications:** This document will detail the core functionalities of our CLI. This includes commands for code modification, building, testing, deployment, committing to version control, and refactoring. We will define the precise syntax and expected behavior for each command.
    * **Non-Functional Specifications:** We will also define the non-functional requirements, such as performance benchmarks for the CLI's responsiveness, the desired level of accuracy for the LLM's code manipulations, and the principles of our command-line user interface design for optimal usability.
    * **Technical Specifications:** This section will outline the core technologies to be used.
        * **Core Language:** C++
        * **LLM Interaction:** `llama.cpp`
        * **Build System:** We will evaluate and choose between robust options like CMake, Meson, or Bazel, with an initial preference for CMake due to its widespread adoption.
        * **CLI Library:** We will select a modern and efficient C++ library for building the command-line interface, such as `CLI11` or `Boost.Program_options`.

### 2. Phase 2: Architectural Design

With the specifications in place, we will move on to designing the software's architecture, focusing on modularity, performance, and extensibility.

* **2.1. Modular Architecture:**
    * We will design the application with a modular architecture to separate concerns and facilitate future development. Key modules will include:
        * A **Core Logic** module responsible for orchestrating the different functionalities.
        * A **`llama.cpp` Interface** module to handle all interactions with the language model.
        * A **File System and System Interaction** module to manage file operations and execute external commands (e.g., build tools, Git).
        * A **CLI** module to handle user input and output.
    * This modular approach will allow us to develop and test each part of the application independently.

* **2.2. `llama.cpp` Integration Strategy:**
    * We will define a clear strategy for integrating `llama.cpp` into our C++ project. This will involve designing how to efficiently load and query the LLMs, manage different models, and process the generated code snippets.

* **2.3. Version Control Integration:**
    * A key feature of our CLI will be its ability to interact with Git. We will design an interface to stage, commit, and push changes, leveraging a C++ Git library like `libgit2` wrapped by a more modern C++ interface like `cppgit2`.

### 3. Phase 3: Development and Implementation

This is the phase where we will bring our design to life, focusing on writing clean, efficient, and well-documented C++ code.

* **3.1. Core Functionality Development:**
    * We will start by implementing the core functionalities, including the `llama.cpp` interface and the file system interaction module.
    * The development will be guided by the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) to ensure the robustness of our code from the very beginning.

* **3.2. CLI Implementation:**
    * We will then build the command-line interface, implementing the commands defined in our specification document.
    * The focus will be on creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

* **3.3. Feature Implementation:**
    * We will then proceed to implement the main features of our CLI, including:
        * **Code Modification:** Implementing the logic to apply the LLM-generated code changes to the source files.
        * **Build and Test:** Integrating with the chosen build system and testing frameworks (e.g., Google Test, Catch2) to automate the build and test processes.
        * **Deployment and Version Control:** Implementing the Git integration for seamless version control and defining a basic deployment workflow.
        * **Refactoring:** Leveraging the LLM's capabilities to propose and apply code refactoring.

### 4. Phase 4: Testing and Quality Assurance

To ensure the reliability and stability of our CLI, we will conduct rigorous testing throughout the development process.

* **4.1. Unit and Integration Testing:**
    * We will write comprehensive unit tests for each module and integration tests to verify the correct interaction between the different parts of our application.

* **4.2. End-to-End Testing:**
    * We will create a suite of end-to-end tests that simulate real-world usage scenarios to validate the complete workflow of our CLI.

* **4.3. Performance and Accuracy Benchmarking:**
    * We will benchmark the performance of our CLI and the accuracy of the LLM's code manipulations against the targets defined in our specification document.

### 5. Phase 5: Deployment and Documentation

Once the development and testing are complete, we will prepare our CLI for public release.

* **5.1. Packaging and Distribution:**
    * We will package our application for the main operating systems (Windows, macOS, and Linux), providing easy-to-use installers and package manager instructions.

* **5.2. Documentation:**
    * We will create comprehensive documentation, including:
        * A user guide with detailed instructions on how to install and use the CLI.
        * A developer guide for those who want to contribute to the project.
        * An API reference for the core libraries.

### 6. Phase 6: Maintenance and Future Roadmap

The launch of our CLI is just the beginning. We will continuously work on improving it and adding new features.

* **6.1. Maintenance:**
    * We will provide ongoing support, fixing bugs, and addressing security vulnerabilities in a timely manner.

* **6.2. Future Roadmap:**
    * We will define a clear roadmap for future development, which could include:
        * Support for more programming languages.
        * Integration with other LLMs.
        * The development of a graphical user interface (GUI).
        * The creation of a plugin system to extend the CLI's functionalities.

I am ready to start working with you on the first phase of this exciting project. Let's begin by further refining the specifications and making our initial technology choices.
