The project is to develop a version of CLAUDE CODE CLI that can run in local using open source LLM. 
We will develop a cli that will interact with interact with the code directly, make modifications, build, test, deploy, commit, push, refactor.
It will only C++ as development language for the core and the interface as well for raw performance and speed. 
It will reuse llama.cpp framework as core to interaract with and run the LLMs.
