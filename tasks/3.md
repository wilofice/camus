Camus - Immediate Next Steps & Feature Polish
Objective
To complete the initial implementation of the core feature set, moving beyond the modify command to make Camus a more fully-featured tool.

Task 1: Implement SysInteraction::executeCommand
Objective: To replace the current stub with a robust, cross-platform implementation for running external shell commands and capturing their output. This is a crucial prerequisite for the commit, build, and test commands.

File to Modify: src/Camus/SysInteraction.cpp

Input: A std::string for the command (e.g., "git") and a std::vector<std::string> for its arguments (e.g., {"diff", "--staged"}).

Output: A std::pair containing the command's combined stdout and stderr as a std::string, and its integer exit code.

Implementation Guidelines:

Construct the full command string from the input arguments.

Use the standard C function popen (or _popen on Windows) to execute the command. This creates a pipe to the command's output stream.

Read the output from the pipe line-by-line into a std::stringstream until the end-of-file is reached.

Close the pipe using pclose (or _pclose), which returns the command's exit code.

Return the accumulated output string and the exit code.

Task 2: Implement the commit Command
Objective: To enable camus commit to automatically generate a commit message from staged changes.

File to Modify: src/Camus/Core.cpp

Input: A Git repository with changes added to the staging area via git add.

Output (to console): An LLM-generated commit message and confirmation prompts.

Implementation Guidelines:

In handleCommit, call m_sys->executeCommand("git", {"diff", "--staged"}).

If the returned output string is empty, print "No changes staged to commit." and exit.

If there is a diff, create a prompt for the LLM that includes the diff output.

Call m_llm->getCompletion() to get the suggested commit message.

Display the message and ask for user confirmation [y/n].

If confirmed, call m_sys->executeCommand("git", {"commit", "-m", llm_message}).

Task 3: Implement build and test Command Wrappers
Objective: To enable camus build and camus test to run user-configured commands and analyze failures with the LLM.

Files to Modify: src/Camus/Core.cpp

Input: A valid .camus/config.yml file with build_command and test_command defined.

Output (to console): Real-time output of the command, followed by an LLM error analysis if it fails.

Implementation Guidelines (for handleBuild):

Read the build_command string from the config file.

Parse the string into a command and its arguments.

Append any passthrough arguments from the user.

Call m_sys->executeCommand() with the parsed command and arguments.

Check the exit code. If it is 0, the command succeeded.

If the exit code is non-zero, send the captured output to the LLM with a prompt asking for an analysis of the build error.

Print the LLM's analysis to the console.

Repeat identical logic for handleTest.
