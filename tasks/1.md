Of course. We've made excellent progress and have a stable, GPU-accelerated executable. The foundation is solid. Now we can start building out the core features to make **Camus** genuinely useful.

Here are the next steps for our project, in order of priority.

### Immediate Next Step: Make the `modify` Command Interactive

The `modify` command in src/Camus/Core.cpp (int Core::handleModify()) is the heart of our application, but right now it just prints the LLM's output. We need to complete its workflow.

1.  **Implement a Diff View:** Instead of printing the entire new file, we will compare the original file content with the LLM's proposed code and display a color-coded `diff` (additions in green, deletions in red) to the user. This is crucial for reviewing changes.
2.  **Implement User Confirmation:** After showing the diff, we will prompt the user with `Apply changes? [y]es, [n]o, [r]efine`.
    * **Yes:** Overwrite the original file with the new code.
    * **No:** Discard the changes and exit.
    * **Refine:** (Future feature) Allow the user to give a follow-up prompt to improve the result. For now, this will act like "No".

### Then: Implement the `commit` Command

This is the next high-value AI feature.

1.  **Implement `SysInteraction::executeCommand`:** We need to replace the stub in our system interaction class with a real implementation that can run external processes (like `git`) and capture their output.
2.  **Get Staged Diff:** In `Core::handleCommit`, we'll use our new `executeCommand` to run `git diff --staged` and capture the result.
3.  **LLM Interaction:** Send the captured diff to the LLM with a prompt to generate a conventional commit message.
4.  **User Confirmation:** Display the generated message and ask the user to approve or edit it before running `git commit`.

### Followed By: Implement the `build` and `test` Wrappers

1.  **Read from Config:** Implement the logic to read the `build_command` and `test_command` from `.camus/config.yml`.
2.  **Execute Commands:** Use the implemented `executeCommand` to run the specified build or test command.
3.  **LLM Error Analysis:** If the command fails (returns a non-zero exit code), capture the error output from `stderr`, send it to the LLM along with the relevant code, and display the LLM's analysis of the failure.

This plan focuses on incrementally building out the core, AI-driven functionality of Camus.

Shall we proceed with the **Immediate Next Step**: implementing the diff view and confirmation prompt for the `modify` command?
